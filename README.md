## Description
As a Boot Camp student who is very new to coding, I am very proactive about making sure I am staying up to date with the course material and my peers. Without some evaluation there is a good chance I will fall behind. Thus, I created this Coding Quiz. It will help me go over past learning materials so I can commit to memory past lessons. It will give me a chance to code incorporating Javascript with HTML and CSS at the same time, developing my abilities further. And it will also give me a chance to see what job interviews using similar methods will be like when I enter the workforce. I have since started to understand how coding elements on different sheets work together to make a website appear and work more functional.

## Usage
When loading the site, you will be presented with a paragraph explaing why the coding quiz exists, along with the parameters used to run the quiz. Hitting 'Start' leads you to the first of 10 questions, which all must be answered within a 2 minute time frame. If you answer a question correctly, you gain a point. If you answer a question wrong, 10 seconds will be taken off your remaining time. Whether you finish all 10 questions or time out, you will be presented with the opportunity to input your initials. Doing so will allow you to see your score, and it will be added to the board of past quiz scores. Then you press the 'Reset' button to start again.
